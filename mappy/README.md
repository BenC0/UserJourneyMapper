# User Joruney Mapper

This project aims to display user journey information in an interactable sunburst chart.

/data_formatter/ was an alpha version script to parse the raw data and format it so the JS could use it. This functionality is now part of the main tool (/mappy/) but the Python scripts have been retained for future reference. Although this script is incomplete, it may be picked up and utilised in the future.
